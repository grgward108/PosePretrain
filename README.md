# PosePretrain

## Overview

This project focuses on pretraining a transformer model on large datasets to enhance the spatial understanding and temporal understanding of human markers.
This module has 2 transformers, Temporal Transformer and Spatial Transformer. 

## Objectives

- Pretrain a transformer model on extensive datasets.
- Improve the model's ability to understand and predict human markers in various spatial contexts.
